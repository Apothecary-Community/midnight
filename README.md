### SVG

if you're going to either edit or add svg assets, it's reccomended to use inkscape, but reqiured to remove metadata . in inkscape, save as a plain svg, in other editors, you can try to find a similar feature, or just simplify it in inkscape afterwards . this makes the svg files much more readable, and easier to work with .
